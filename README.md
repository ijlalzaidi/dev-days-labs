![Dev Days Labs](header.png)

We invite you to join the Xamarin Dev Days Labs challenge: a fast, easy, and fun way to explore native mobile development with Xamarin. Each lab consists of a small programming challenge involving a specific set of APIs or a particular third-party programming framework. 

Labs are designed to stimulate developers of all skill levelsâ€”each challenge comes with step-by-step instructions to guide you if you get stuck. You can find all of the challenges in this GitHub repository.

To get started, click one of the labs above and attempt to complete the challenge that is described in the included README file.
